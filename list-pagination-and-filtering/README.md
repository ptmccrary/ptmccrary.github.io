# List Pagination and Filtering

 Displays list of 54 Students

 Added JavaScript to filter the number of students per page to 10 and paginate the student list based on the amount of students.

 Added the search bar for extra work to search for a specific student. Used the keyup event listener to update the list as the user types, as well as a click event listener to the button for someone who pastes a name in the search bar.

 Program will display 'No Results' if there are no matches within the search bar.
